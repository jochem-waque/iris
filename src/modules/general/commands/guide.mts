- "Variety gaming, parallel play | quiet talking"
- "Playing minecraft, talking | loud"

Once again, these topics convey accurately what's going on in a VC to people who are not involved in it. Specifically describing that the conversation isn't related to the games that are being played will allow people to deduce that they can join a VC even if they are not able to play the game.`,

Sure, you said that gaming is going on in the VC, but if somebody isn't in the VC, they're only going to know that you're gaming. They're not going to know which game, whether or not you guys are talking while you game, or the volume of the VC.`,
